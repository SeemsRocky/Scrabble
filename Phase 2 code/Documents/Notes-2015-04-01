In the second meeting,the team went over which task(s) everyone had to do. We had to name our task again so
everyone knows which task they are responsible for. After we went over one by one, what difficulties might
appear within each task and make sure everyone will know how to complete their task. We promptly asked the 
TA how to deal with these problems and decided on the next meeting day.
