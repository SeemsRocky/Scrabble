In the first meeting, the team decided to look over the code that was provided and discuss what 
might be right and wrong with each classes. While the verbal evaluation of the code was in process, 
we thought it might be beneficial to critique the code. After we were done with critiquing all the 
codebases, we discussed which codebase suits us best and might be helpful as we progressed to work 
on the Stage 2 of the project. Our final decision was to work with CodeBase E.
We also came up with tasks for every team member. 
Meng Chun Hsih is working on the UI of the project, i.e, TASK 2. 
Dhruv Kumar is working on Othello Scoring, i.e, TASK 6.
Jonathan He is working on dictionary and validating words, i.e, TASK 5.
Rocky Liao is working on adding high score functionality to the game, i.e, TASK 4.
Adhish Chugh is working on save/restore functionality and command line arguments, i.e, TASK 3 and 7.
We have decided that we will meet once a week to assist each other with problems we may have encountered.
