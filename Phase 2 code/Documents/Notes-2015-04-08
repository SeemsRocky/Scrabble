We discussed about which methods have to be finished. We had members talk with Chris if they
have a problem with their task(s).We found a problem with task 2 and now have multiple 
members helping out on completing the task. We also discussed about the timeframe left for 
us to complete the rest of stage 2. We are in a pretty good position for completing stage 2
on time.
